# Peer dependency handling with pnpm-style peer contexts. pnpm defaults
# to `auto-install-peers=true`, so a package that declares a required peer
# gets that peer installed as a sibling symlink inside its own
# `node_modules/` — which is how Node's module resolver finds it when the
# package does `require('react')`. Our resolver's peer-context post-pass
# additionally suffixes each consumer's dep_path with `(peer@ver)` so the
# same package with different peer resolutions lands in separate
# `.aube/` directories, matching pnpm's v9 lockfile shape.
